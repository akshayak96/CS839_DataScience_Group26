<person>Adriano</>'s Chelsea link rejected

<person>Adriano</>'s agent <person>Gilmar Rinaldi</> has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker.

Chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about Inter Milan's 22-year-old Brazilian star. <person>Rinaldi</> told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: "I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or <person>Adriano</>. "Parma and Real Madrid are interested but there's nothing new there. Their interest has been known for some time." <person>Adriano</> has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season. And Chelsea boss <person>Jose Mourinho</> had claimed that he was in Milan talking to <person>Adriano</> on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender <person>Ashley Cole</>. <person>Mourinho</> said he was "just practising my Portuguese with him because I don't need strikers". <person>Rinaldi</> told BBC Sport: "I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me. "If they want to, that's fine. I can tell them what the situation is. "If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer." Inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of Â£40m on the head of <person>Adriano</>, who joined them just over a year ago from Parma. Real Madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot <person>Ronaldo</>. But <person>Rinaldi</> said: "I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for <person>Adriano</>. That's something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs."

<person>Prutton</> poised for lengthy FA ban

Southampton's <person>David Prutton</> faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the Football Association.

The 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal. The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee <person>Alan Wiley</> and remonstrating with assistant referee <person>Paul Norman</>. And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.

<person>Paolo di Canio</> was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee <person>Paul Alcock</> over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998. <person>Prutton</> will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss <person>Harry Redknapp</>, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player. <person>Redknapp</> himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio <person>Jim Joyce</> and coach <person>Denis Rofe</> shepherd the enraged <person>Prutton</> away from referee's assistant <person>Norman</>. "<person>David</> has made a big mistake and he knows it. I can't condone what he's done. He was out of order but he knows that," said <person>Redknapp</>. "He's a decent lad. He over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. Off the pitch you couldn't meet a nicer lad." <person>Prutton</> has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenal's <person>Robert Pires</>, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints' midfield man.

He said: "It's an horrendous situation. I apologise to the ref and linesman, who were only doing their job. "I've also seen what happened to <person>Pires</>' leg and I'm sorry for that as well." "I apologise for the people who saw it. I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don't pay money to see that sort of thing. "It's not a cop-out, but it was all a bit of a blur. Sometimes you react and it's beyond your control, " added <person>Prutton</>.

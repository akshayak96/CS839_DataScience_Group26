Injury doubts beset Wales squad

Wales have a clutch of injury worries before Wednesday's international friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.

West Ham's <person>Gavin Williams</> (ankle) looks certain to be out, so uncapped Wrexham defender <person>Stephen Roberts</> is drafted in. Defenders <person>Danny Gabbidon</> and <person>Gareth Roberts</>, plus <person>Ryan Giggs</> have hamstring concerns, while there are also doubts over <person>Robbie Savage</> (groin). However, Manchester United winger <person>Giggs</> is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the Millennium Stadium. There were also doubts over <person>Gabbidon</>'s fellow Cardiff defender <person>Rhys Weston</>, but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the Bluebirds' 1-0 loss to West Ham on Sunday. The news leaves Wales boss <person>John Toshack</> short in defence for his first game in charge, with Aston Villa's <person>Mark Delaney</> injured and <person>James Collins</> with the Under-21s. That could clear the way for new faces <person>Danny Collins</> and <person>Dave Partridge</> to make their Wales debuts.

Newcastle 27-27 Gloucester

Newcastle centre <person>Mathew Tait</> answered his critics as he scored one try and made another, but he could not stop Gloucester grabbing a draw.

The Falcons were 22-6 down at the break before <person>Tait</>, recently axed by England after just one Six Nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. A last-gasp touchdown from Luke Narraway pulled the visitors level. But Gloucester missed out on victory when <person>Henry Paul</> fluffed the conversion and <person>Seti Kiole</> was denied a late try. Newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. But they failed to make them count until <person>Joe Shaw</> found <person>Dave Walder</>, who released <person>Mark Mayerholfer</> in his own 22.

The former All Black broke clear and popped the ball up for <person>Tait</> on halfway. He chipped ahead for <person>Michael Stephenson</> to scorch through for the try, which Walder converted to give Newcastle a lifeline. They grabbed it with both hands, <person>Mayerhofler</> breaking through and <person>Tait</> making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race 30m to score. <person>Walder</> converted to make it 22-20 before he was just wide with a 40m penalty in the 70th minute.

<person>Mayerhofler</> then scythed through the middle for a try after <person>Hall Charlton</> popped the ball up, and <person>Walder</>'s conversion took Newcastle 27-22 ahead. With three minutes of normal time left, <person>Narraway</> was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27. <person>Henry</> missed the conversion but Gloucester nearly won it when <person>Kiole</> broke through only to be hauled down by <person>Charlton</> and <person>Tom May</>.

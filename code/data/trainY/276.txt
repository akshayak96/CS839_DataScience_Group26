Mexicans tracking unhappy <person>Juninho</>

Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz hope to sign <person>Juninho</> if the Brazilian decides to leave Celtic frustrated at his lack of first-team action.

Their president, <person>Gustavo Parente Sanchez</>, says <person>Juninho</> "does not wish to remain in Scottish football anymore". Agent <person>Brian Hassell</> insists that the 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place. "But, if the manager is not going to pick him, that's a different ball game," he told The Sun. "That's something we'd have to look at. <person>Juninho</> deserves respect. He is not a little kid." <person>Hassell</> warns that <person>Juninho</> could reconsider his future at Celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the January transfer window.

<person>Juninho</> was signed from Middlesbrough during the summer, but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to 18-year-old <person>Aiden McGeady</>. "He has 50 caps for Brazil and he's the best signing Celtic ever made," insisted <person>Hassell</>. "He wants to play for <person>Martin O'Neill</>, but does <person>Martin O'Neill</> want to play him? "<person>Juninho</> is not someone who has come through the Celtic ranks. He deserves much more respect." <person>Sanchez</> is bullish about his hopes of prising Juninho from the Scottish champions, although <person>Hassell</> believes Mexico would not be his preferred destination. "We have already spoken with <person>Juninho</> and he said, if he has no firm offer from a club in Spain, Veracruz will be his destination," <person>Sanchez</> told his club's official website. Celtic manager <person>O'Neill</> is no respecter of reputations. "The onus is on <person>Juninho</> to force his way into the team," he said. "Players get a game on merit. That's the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at Celtic Park."

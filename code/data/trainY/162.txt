<person>Cole</> faces lengthy injury lay-off

Aston Villa's <person>Carlton Cole</> could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.

The striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. "<person>Carlton</> will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge," said Villa boss <person>David O'Leary</>. "I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea." <person>Cole</>, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because <person>O'Leary</> had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of <person>Darius Vassell</> after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of <person>Luke Moore</> has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.

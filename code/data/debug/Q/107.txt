Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.

<person>Alan Archibald</> prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and <person>James Grady</> made it two from close range 10 minutes later. <person>Richie Byrne</>'s header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but <person>Stevie Crawford</> restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by <person>Grady</> just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. <person>Tony Bullock</> in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. <person>Noel Whelan</> laid the ball off to <person>Jamie Winter</> on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. <person>Barry Robson</> whipped in a free kick from the right, which <person>Stevie Crawford</> caught on the volley. <person>Russell Anderson</> failed to deal with it and <person>Whelan</>'s clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when <person>Grady</> tapped the ball into an empty net after <person>Robson</> had headed <person>Mark Wilson</>'s cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by <person>Winter</> was met powerfully by the head of <person>Byrne</> at the back post, leaving <person>Bullock</> helpless.

United restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. <person>Jason Scotland</> played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing <person>Crawford</> and he coolly beat <person>Ryan Esson</> from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. <person>Grady</> received a pass from <person>Crawford</> with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of <person>Esson</>. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out <person>Robson</>'s drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area. <person>Robson</> saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line.

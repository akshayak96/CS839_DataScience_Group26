Hearts 2-1 Livingston

Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes.

<person>Lee Miller</> scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over <person>Colin Meldrum</> and into the net from a <person>Jamie McAllister</> free kick. <person>McAllister</> himself scored the second when he met <person>Saul Mikoliunas</>' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. <person>Craig Easton</> headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after <person>Gus Bahoken</> had clumsily fouled <person>Miller</> 35 yards from goal. <person>McAllister</> floated the free kick into the Livi box and <person>Miller</> outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over <person>Meldrum</>. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. <person>Mikoliunas</> sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where <person>McAllister</> raced in to head past <person>Meldrum</>. Moments later <person>Miller</> came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.

Then <person>McAllister</> picked up a pass from <person>Stephen Simmons</> and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past <person>Meldrum</>'s far post. The impressive <person>Mikoliunas</> twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by <person>Meldrum</> and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager <person>Richard Gough</> made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender <person>Goran Stanic</>, midfielder <person>Gabor Vincze</>, and striker <person>Ferenc Horvath</> for <person>Bahoken</>, <person>Derek Lilley</> and <person>Mark Wilson</>. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. <person>Eric Deloumeaux</> sent <person>Jason Dair</> away on the right and he tried to give the ball to <person>McPake</>, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and <person>Dair</> ran on to it and played <person>Easton</> in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against <person>McPake</> but referee <person>Alan Freeland</> ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, <person>Burton O'Brien</> was hauled back at the edge of the box by <person>Neil MacFarlane</>, but <person>Dair</> sent his shot just inches wide.

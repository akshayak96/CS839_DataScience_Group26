Arsenal through on penalties

Arsenal win 4-2 on penalties

The Spanish goalkeeper saved from <person>Alan Quinn</> and <person>Jon Harley</> as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. <person>Lauren</>, <person>Patrick Vieira</>, <person>Freddie Ljungberg</> and <person>Ashley Cole</> scored for Arsenal, while <person>Andy Gray</> and <person>Phil Jagielka</> were on target for the Blades. <person>Michael Tonge</> and <person>Harley</> wasted chances for the underdogs, but <person>Paddy Kenny</> was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as <person>Thierry Henry</> and <person>Dennis Bergkamp</>, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker <person>Arturo Lupoli</> with <person>Ljungberg</> up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as <person>Tonge</> wasted a glorious chance. <person>Gray</> ran free down the right flank, and his cross left <person>Tonge</> with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.

Arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although <person>Ljungberg</> turned a half-chance wide after good work by <person>Cesc Fabregas</>. <person>Arsene Wenger</> introduced <person>Quincy Owusu-Abeyie</> for the ineffective <person>Lupoli</> at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by <person>Mathieu Flamini</>, but his finish was tame and <person>Kenny</> saved easily. <person>Owusu-Abeyie</> then fired in a testing cross, which was met by <person>Fabregas</>, and it needed a desperate clearance by <person>Kenny</>'s legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when <person>Fabregas</> crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by <person>Jagielka</> to deny <person>Ljungberg</> as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again <person>Kenny</> was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. <person>Neil Warnock</>'s side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when <person>Derek Geary</>'s cross found <person>Harley</> at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by <person>Almunia</>. <person>Owusu-Abeyie</>'s pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for <person>Ljungberg</>. <person>Pascal Cygan</> missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on <person>Jeremie Aliadiere</> with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. <person>Kolo Toure</>'s misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but <person>Kenny</> once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. <person>Almunia</> was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.

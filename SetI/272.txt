Newcastle to join <person>Morientes</> race

Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker <person>Fernando Morientes</> and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.

Liverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss <person>Rafa Benitez</> will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to <person>Nicolas Anelka</>. Real are believed to still want £7m before selling <person>Morientes</>. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.

On Tuesday, <person>Morientes</> had said: "I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. "Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. "I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.

"I haven't spoken to <person>Rafa Benitez</> but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But <person>Benitez</> could yet turn his attentions to the younger <person>Anelka</> should <person>Morientes</> be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. <person>Anelka</> previously played at Anfield under <person>Gerard Houllier</> before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.

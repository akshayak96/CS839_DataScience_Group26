Barcelona title hopes hit by loss

Barcelona's pursuit of the Spanish title took a blow on Sunday as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at home to Atletico Madrid.

<person>Fernando Torres</> gave Athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute. <person>Ronaldino</> wasted a second-half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide, but <person>Torres</> made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. The defeat, coupled with Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday, reduces Barca's lead to four points. Former Everton midfielder <person>Thomas Gravesen</> scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu. <person>Zinedine Zidane</> had opened the scoring before <person>Raul</> bagged a brace. <person>Gravesen</>, who replaced <person>Zidane</>, completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. <person>David Beckham</>, watched by <person>Sven-Goran Eriksson</>, came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for England's game against Holland. England team-mate <person>Michael Owen</> came on for <person>Raul</> after 76 minutes with the game already won. Real have now won six consecutive Primera Liga games since coach <person>Wanderley Luxemburgo</> took charge.

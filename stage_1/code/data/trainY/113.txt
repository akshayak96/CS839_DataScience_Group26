<person>Wright-Phillips</> to start on right

England coach <person>Sven-Goran Eriksson</> has revealed <person>Shaun Wright-Phillips</> will start against the Netherlands.

But <person>Wright-Phillips</> will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected. "<person>Shaun Wright-Phillips</> will probably start the game," said <person>Eriksson</>. "But I'm not going to start <person>Wright-Phillips</> on the left." <person>Eriksson</> also revealed that <person>Wes Brown</> will start alongside <person>Jamie Carragher</> in the injury-hit centre of defence. When asked if <person>Brown</> and <person>Carragher</> would start <person>Eriksson</> replied: "I could tell you yes. "It's a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries. "On the other hand it's good for <person>Carragher</> and <person>Brown</> to show what they can do at this level. That's positive." The England coach said that he had been impressed by <person>Wright-Phillips</>' form for Manchester City. "He deserves his chance. He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him." And he added that <person>Andy Johnson</> and <person>Stewart Downing</> - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress. "<person>Wright-Phillips</>, <person>Downing</> and <person>Johnson</> will start or get the chance to play some part. "<person>Johnson</> was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals. "<person>Downing</> is another one making a great season. He is young, talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad."

<person>Dunne keen</> to commit to Man City

<person>Richard Dunne</> is ready to commit his long-term future to Manchester City after turning his career around.

He was once threatened with the sack by City boss <person>Kevin Keegan</> but has since responded with impressive performances, prompting interest from other clubs. Early talks have taken place and the defender said: "Hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible. "I definitely want to stay at City because I have really improved as a player here." Newcastle boss <person>Graeme Souness</> is said to have been impressed enough by <person>Dunne</>'s turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the January transfer window. But the 25-year-old Dubliner underlined his intention to stay at Eastlands. He added: "It's nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do. "I really enjoy it at City and I want to keep that going." <person>Keegan</> is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in January. <person>Dunne</>'s professionalism was famously questioned by <person>Keegan</>, who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state.

But <person>Dunne</> is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said: "I've grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad. "I've played more games than any other outfield players this season so I can't be regarded as being a kid any more. "I have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at Newcastle and Middlesbrough, defensively we've done quite well." <person>Keegan</> is set for another boost when goalkeeper <person>Nicky Weaver</> makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at Blackburn on Tuesday. Former England Under-21 keeper <person>Weaver</> has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries, which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.

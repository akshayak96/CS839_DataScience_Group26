<person>Redknapp</> poised for Saints

Southampton are set to unveil <person>Harry Redknapp</> as their new manager at a news conference at 1500 GMT on Wednesday.

The former Portsmouth boss replaces <person>Steve Wigley</>, who has been relieved of first-team duties after just one win in 14 league games in charge. <person>Redknapp</>, 57, quit his Fratton Park position on 24 November and vowed: "I will not go down the road - no chance." Pompey coach <person>Kevin Bond</> is poised to join <person>Redknapp</>, who will be Saints' third boss of the season. <person>Redknapp</>'s first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Portsmouth chairman <person>Milan Mandaric</> said he was "disappointed" by the news and claimed <person>Redknapp</> had been in talks with Southampton for "some time".

"It would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time," <person>Mandaric</> said on Portsmouth's official website. "I am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of Southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed." According to <person>Mandaric</>, <person>Redknapp</> vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. "I said to <person>Harry</> 'I hope you don't go to Southampton', and he told me 'absolutely not'," he said. "I'm wouldn't say I'm bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it's <person>Harry</>'s life and it's his decision." <person>Redknapp</> became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with <person>Mandaric</>'s decision to bring in <person>Velimir Zajec</> as executive director.

Southampton chairman <person>Rupert Lowe</> was desperate to give former academy director <person>Wigley</>, who replaced <person>Paul Sturrock</> just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary's. But results under <person>Wigley</> have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. When <person>Redknapp</>'s appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints' ninth manager in eight years.

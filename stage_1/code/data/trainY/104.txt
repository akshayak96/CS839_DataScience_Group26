Chelsea clinch cup in extra-time

(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)

<person>John Arne Riise</> volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but <person>Steven Gerrard</> scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss <person>Jose Mourinho</> was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. <person>Drogba</> and <person>Kezman</> scored from close range before <person>Antonio Nunez</>'s header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after <person>Mourinho</>'s sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.

<person>Riise</> could not have connected any better with <person>Morientes</>' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past <person>Petr Cech</>. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and <person>Jerzy Dudek</> was equal to <person>Frank Lampard</>'s powerfully-struck drive and <person>Drogba</>'s low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.

<person>Joe Cole</> had a shot blocked and a promising <person>Damien Duff</> break was halted by a good tackle from <person>Djimi Traore</>, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from <person>Dudek</> on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from <person>Gudjohnsen</>'s header, then to smother <person>William Gallas</>' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as <person>Luis Garcia</> fed <person>Dietmar Hamann</> whose shot forced a superb save from <person>Cech</>. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as <person>Paulo Ferreira</> denied <person>Gerrard</> with a last-ditch tackle. But <person>Gerrard</> was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected <person>Ferrerira</>'s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted <person>Mourinho</>'s reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and <person>Duff</> had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. <person>Dudek</> saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while <person>Milan Baros</> shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. <person>Drogba</> almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, <person>Drogba</> made no mistake, picking the ball up from <person>Glen Johnson</>'s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And <person>Kezman</> appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after <person>Gudjohnsen</>'s cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as <person>Nunez</> beat <person>Cech</> to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.

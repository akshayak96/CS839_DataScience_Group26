<person>Souness</> backs <person>Smith</> for Scotland

<person>Graeme Souness</> believes <person>Walter Smith</> would be the perfect choice to succeed <person>Berti Vogts</> as Scotland manager.

<person>Souness</>'s former assistant at Rangers is hot favourite to take over from <person>Vogts</>, who resigned on Monday. "<person>Walter</> is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. He'd be perfect for it," <person>Souness</> told BBC Sport. The Scottish Football Association has appointed <person>Tommy Burns</> as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November. "He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football. He is experienced and has been successful." <person>Souness</> added: "<person>Walter</> is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox. "On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football." <person>Souness</> joined Sir <person>Alex Ferguson</> in backing <person>Smith</>'s claims. The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing <person>Tommy Burns</> in a caretaker capacity. <person>Ferguson</> said: "He (<person>Smith</>) would be the outstanding candidate as far as I'm concerned. "You need somebody who knows what they're doing and <person>Walter</> would bring a wealth of experience to the job." The Man Utd boss continued: "I don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. "He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. "He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed." <person>Smith</> was assistant to <person>Ferguson</> at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. BBC Sport understands that <person>Smith</> would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA.

If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain <person>Smith</>'s long-time right-hand man <person>Archie Knox</> would also play a part in the national team set-up. <person>Smith</> already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager <person>Craig Brown</>. <person>Brown</> said: "<person>Walter</> is an outstanding candidate without doubt. "He would be admirable choice. I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it. He was asking me about it and I was positive." Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders <person>Gordon Strachan</> and <person>Gary McAllister</> and <person>Vogts</>' assistant <person>Tommy Burns</>.

London Irish 19-33 Wasps

Wasps made light of the absence of several internationals to sink London Irish with a trio of second-half tries.

<person>Rob Hoadley</> returned to haunt his old club at the Madejski Stadium, scoring the opening try in the 43rd minute. <person>Tom Voyce</> powered through the Irish defence for Wasps' second try before <person>Richard Birkett</> went over unchallenged. <person>Mark van Gisbergen</> added 18 points. Irish replied with three penalties and a <person>Mark Mapletoft</> drop goal before <person>Scott Staniforth</> ran in a consolation try. <person>Barry Everitt</>, who replaced <person>Mapletoft</> late in the game, added the conversion to become the fourth Premiership player to reach 1,000 points. He joins <person>Jonny Wilkinson</>, <person>Tim Stimpson</> and <person>Paul Grayson</> in achieving that target. Wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point, but they were denied by some desperate defending from Irish. Director of rugby <person>Warren Gatland</> revealed that harsh words at half-time inspired his Wasps side to raise their game after the restart.

"They got a roasting and it was a good second-half performance when they came out and played to instructions," he said. <person>Gatland</> also singled out stand-in flankers <person>Tom Rees</> and <person>John Hart</> for special praise. "They did very well. The back row played some fantastic rugby," he added. London Irish coach <person>Gary Gold</> felt the result exposed his side's lack of consistency.

Irish trailed by just two points at the break and <person>Gold</> said: "For 55 minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full 80 minutes." <person>Gold</> will now turn his attention to next week's Powergen Cup semi-final at struggling Leeds. "We've got a good chance but with Leeds facing possible relegation they're going to come out firing," he added.

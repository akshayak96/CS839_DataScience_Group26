Reds sink 10-man Magpies

<person>Titus Bramble</>'s own goal put Liverpool on the comeback trail as injury-hit Newcastle were well beaten at Anfield.

<person>Patrick Kluivert</>'s close-range finish put Newcastle ahead after 31 minutes, but they were pegged back as <person>Bramble</> headed in <person>Steven Gerrard</>'s corner. <person>Neil Mellor</> gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from <person>Milan Baros</>' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had <person>Lee Bowyer</> sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back <person>Luis Garcia</> after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after <person>Craig Bellamy</> was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And <person>Garcia</> should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from <person>Baros</> but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. <person>Olivier Bernard</> was only inches away from giving Newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. But <person>Souness</>'s side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances.

<person>Kluivert</> looked suspiciously offside when <person>Kieron Dyer</> set <person>Bowyer</> free, but the Dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. The lead lasted three minutes, with Liverpool back on terms as Bramble headed <person>Gerrard</>'s corner into his own net under pressure from <person>Sami Hyypia</>. And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when <person>Baros</> slid a perfect pass into <person>Mellor</>'s path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into <person>Given</>'s bottom corner. <person>Garcia</>'s finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at <person>Given</> after good work by <person>Xabi Alonso</>. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by <person>Harry Kewell</> set <person>Baros</> free and he rounded <person>Given</> to score. <person>Jermaine Jenas</> then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross. Then Bowyer, who had already been booked for a foul on <person>Alonso</>, was deservedly shown the red card by referee <person>Graham Poll</> for a wild challenge on Liverpool substitute <person>Florent Sinama-Pongolle</>.

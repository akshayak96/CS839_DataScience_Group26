Germany coach <person>Jurgen Klinsmann</> has warned goalkeeper <person>Jens Lehmann</> he may have to quit Arsenal to keep his World Cup dreams alive.

<person>Lehmann</> is understudy to <person>Oliver Kahn</> in the German squad, but has lost his place to <person>Manuel Alumnia</> at Highbury. <person>Klinsmann</> said: "It will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club. "If <person>Jens</> is not Arsenal's number one keeper, that is a problem for me. He must be playing regularly." <person>Lehmann</> is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006. <person>Klinsmann</> added: "If he is not playing regularly he cannot be Germany's number one keeper, or even number two keeper. "The situation for <person>Jens</> is that he is currently the number two keeper at Arsenal. This could be critical if it remains the same during next season."

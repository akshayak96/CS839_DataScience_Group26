England's defensive crisis grows

England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's <person>Ledley King</> from the squad to face Holland.

Chelsea's <person>John Terry</> and <person>Wayne Bridge</> are also out, leaving coach <person>Sven-Goran Eriksson</> with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park. Injured <person>Rio Ferdinand</> and <person>Sol Campbell</> were both left out of the squad, and <person>Matthew Upson</> has already pulled out. <person>Wes Brown</> and <person>Jamie Carragher</> are likely to be the makeshift partnership. <person>Terry</>, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of <person>Campbell</> and <person>Ferdinand</>. But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by <person>Carragher</>, alongside <person>Brown</>.

Manchester United's <person>Brown</> last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003. The 25-year-old was only called into the squad on Sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of <person>Upson</>, who has a hamstring injury. And <person>Brown</> now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England. <person>King</> was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by England's medical staff. <person>Eriksson</> has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up, having already summoned <person>Phil Neville</> after <person>Bridge</> pulled out with a foot injury.

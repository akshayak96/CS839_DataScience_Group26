Celtic make late bid for <person>Bellamy</>

Newcastle striker <person>Craig Bellamy</> is discussing a possible short-term loan move to Celtic, BBC Sport understands.

The Welsh striker has rejected a move to Birmingham after falling out with Magpies manager <person>Graeme Souness</>. The Toon boss vowed <person>Bellamy</> would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against Arsenal. Celtic are in no position to match Birmingham's Â£6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit <person>Bellamy</> while he considers his future. According to <person>Bellamy</>'s agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to Birmingham. And it is unlikely that Newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another Premiership club.

<person>Bellamy</> was fined two weeks' wages after a live TV interview in which he accused <person>Souness</> of lying, following a very public dispute about what position <person>Bellamy</> should play in the side. <person>Souness</> said: "He can't play for me ever again. He has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club. "He can't go on television and accuse me of telling lies." Chairman <person>Freddy Shepherd</> described <person>Bellamy</>'s behaviour as "totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional".
